# Serverless DIARY

A simple DIARY application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework.

# Functionality of the application

Pick your mood like(rad, good, meh, bad, or awful) and add activities like (friends, date, exercise, sport, relax, movies, gaming, reading, cleaning, sleep early, eat healthy or shopping) you have been doing during the day and also add notes.

This application allows creating/removing/updating/fetching DIARY items. Each DIARY item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to DIARY items that he/she has created.

# DIARY items

The application should store DIARY items, and each DIARY item contains the following fields:

* `diaryId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `mood` (string) - mood of the user (e.g. "Good")
* `activities` (string) - user writes the activites he did through the day (e.g. "Play tennis")
* `dayGoalDone` (boolean) - true if the user complete the day goal that he decided for that day, false otherwise
* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a DIARY item

I also store an id of a user who created a DIARY item.
